Hi. IÂ´m looking to find developers interested on creating an idea I have. I create a token on waves. that i want to use to reward people in order to complete some tasks like social actions, surveys, installations, and so with our tokens, then those tokens can be used to buy digital assets, services and other stuff.

I want to be able to post jobs at any time and to reward users on my site with my tokens.

the application consists in a plataform where the webpage visitor first register (as an artist or as a fan), then he/she needs to confirm their email, and login. 

When the user is logged in he will have different options. Their profile, their available tasks (bounties), and his balance.

The main page on user control panel or frontpage will show the available tasks to get his tokens.

Finally we need a administration panel to publish tasks, to reward bounties and handle some stats.

check this page. beat.org they have something similar. 

another good example is https://bounties.network/

Any other question, I will be happy to send more details if needed
